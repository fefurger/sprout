PERSONAL PROJECTS (OUTSIDE ACADEMIC WORK)

Conception of a small robot (Seek4Light), trained with reinforcement learning to move towards light sources in order to charge its battery, first in a simulated environment and then, once deployed on an Arduino card equipped with photosensors, in the real world.
- Python (tensorflow / keras), Arduino

Development and  deployment of a web app for the wildlife photography community in order to share photos or stories, and keep track of one’s wildlife observations (species classification based on the ISIS collaborative database).
- Python back-end (flask), HTML / CSS, MySQL

Development of a “dictionnary game” in the form of a multi-player web app.
- Python back-end (flask), HTML / CSS

Development of a 2D game in Python. The player is connected to an Arduino card thanks to electromyography sensors (EMG) so that the player’s physical activity dictates the behavior of the in-game character (runner-type game).
