My name is FÃ©lix Furger, and I am 27 years old from France. My partner, who is Australian, and I have been living in France for the past few years but are now relocating to Australia to be closer to her family. I have applied for a partner visa, which will eventually grant me permanent residency. In the meantime, I am on a bridging visa that gives me full working rights in Australia, so I don't require sponsorship or any additional support in that regard.

Since my last work experience, I traveled around Australia while waiting for my bridging visa to be approved, as my tourist visa did not allow me to work. Now that my work rights are in place, I am ready to begin my next professional chapter.

I have a deep interest in the field of AI/ML, and the recent advancements in Generative AI, such as LLMs and Diffusion models, have been particularly fascinating. I was genuinely impressed by their efficiency and potential. While most of my experience lies in more traditional AI/ML techniques, I am eager to contribute to the rapidly growing and transformative area of Gen AI.

Though I do not have professional experience specifically in Gen AI, aside from work with Variational Autoencoders, I am actively learning popular tools like LlamaIndex to build AI applications.

I believe this application highlights my interest and motivation in Gen AI, even though it is still in its early stages. Gen AI is a fast-evolving field, and I am excited to stay adaptable and contribute to its growth. I strongly believe it will be a major part of the future, and I am determined to be a part of that journey.
