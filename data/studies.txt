I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science from CY-TECH (formerly EISTI), and my studies covered a wide range of programming languages and tools. In my final year, I specialized in Artificial Intelligence (AI), where I gained hands-on experience with various Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including traditional ML methods, data mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning, and computer vision tasks like image classification and sound recognition. This provided me with a comprehensive overview of the key ML/DL techniques.
